**Images Responsiver is a simple solution for most responsive images needs**.

Responsive images are **difficult to implement**, but **required to provide a good performance to Web users**.

## A Node.js library to ease responsive images

Images Responsiver transforms plain, simple `<img src="â€¦">` HTML tags into better responsive images syntax with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

Knowing that [`<picture>` is only required for rare advanced usages](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/), **Images Responsiver should be enough for most use cases**, where the need is known as Resolution Switching.

Read [this article on Cloudfour's blog to know more of the theory](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-the-simple-way/).

## A plugin for Eleventy

**Images Responsiver** is also available as a plugin for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a great Static Site Generator. It allows authors to use the simple and standard Markdown syntax for images (`![alt text](image.jpg)`) and yet get responsive images in the generated HTML, with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.
