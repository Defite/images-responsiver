## Step 2: Better behavior with `images-responsiver` and default configuration

You can use this Node.js script:

<script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/nhoizey/images-responsiver/raw/master/examples/01_default/run.js"></script>

Run it from the command line:

```bash
node run.js
```

You'll get the enhanced page in this new HTML file:

<script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/nhoizey/images-responsiver/raw/master/examples/01_default/page-enhanced.html"></script>

_Note: a `pristine` value is added to the image's dataset with the original URL, in case you want to do anything else with it later (provide a "zoom" link for example)._

The situation is better, because users with small viewports (and reasonable screen densities) will download smaller images.

But there are a few issues:

- The `sizes` attributes with a `100vw` value tells the browser that the image will be rendered on the full width of the viewport, but that's not what we want:
  - We know the second image (`my-photo.jpg`) should occupy only the width of the content, which per CSS rules is `90vw` with a maximum of `40em`. This `40em` width for the content is reached when the viewport reaches `40 / 0.9 = 45em` (rounded). So we should be able to set a `sizes` attribute with the value `(max-width: 45em) 90vw, 40em` (or `(min-width: 45em) 40em, 90vw` but the result is the same).
  - For the logo (the first image), we need one fifth of the content width, so the `sizes` attribute value is simple math from the previous one: `(max-width: 45em) 18vw, 8em`.
- If the maximum width for the logo is `8em` on largest viewports, and most users have a browser with a default root font size of `16px`, these `8em` are computed to `128px`. Let's consider the user is on a high density display ("Retina" in Apple language), so double it, and that [the user might need to increase the font size for readability](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2018/06/15/users-do-change-font-size/), so double it a second time. We then need an image with a maximum useful width of `512px`. We see the HTML tells the browser that the maximum width for the image is `2560px` (the `w` descriptor is the "`w`idth in pixels"). Far beyond what we need! We should be able to set a maximum (and sometimes a minimum) for the sequence of image widths in the `srcset` attribute.

These issues exist because there is no default configuration that would be correct for all use cases.

Let's tell the `images-responsiver` what to do with the imagesâ€¦
